Iâ€™m currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at ISTI-CNR on themes related (but not limited) to clustering, pattern recognition, and multi-view learning in federated and non-federated environments. My works will include mathematical optimization with application to address (benchmarking) real-world data sets in critical areas.   

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics from  Chung Yuan Christian University, under the guidance of [Prof. Miin-Shen Yang](https://msyang3.wixsite.com/msyang/english).
